# DAT515

Labs for the course DAT515 Advanced programming in python. The purpose of the labs was to program an application to find the shortest path (timewise and geographically) between tramstops in a generic tramnetwork, taking into account linesswitches and waiting time. This was done using Djikstra shortest path finding algorithm and distance calculations assuming a spherical earth based on lon lat data. The program was then visualized using django as a web application. 

The most interesting code can be found under lab3 -> tram -> utils.
